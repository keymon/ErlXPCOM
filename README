This is the source code of my Final Degree Project:

Integration of Erlang/OTP with Mozilla XPFE (Cross Platform Front End)

It is called ErlXPCOM.

Sadly I discontinued this project. I started to work and I had no
time and direct motivation to continue it. 

But I hope finish a production ready version...

This is the first commit in my github.com account.
